Good Guy Knight is the first game I've ever made.

Therefore, I made it with a goal in mind and a time frame as well. I learned a ton about GameMaker Studio while I was making this game, and it honestly was tons of fun to be learning- and at the same time applying that knowledge.



Anyway, Good Guy Knight is just a simple platformer about a knight who's trying to be a good guy, but, I love sarcasm and irony, so it doesn't quite play out so well.

Hope you enjoy the game, and I'm happy to take any complaints/criticisms/compliments because after all- this is my first game, and I have a far way to go from here, to AAA style art, controls, and look.

Thanks, and I'll hopefully see you when I make my next one. :)



## CONTROLS

WASD to move around

E to attack/interact

F for special ability (activated later)

R to reset (respawn instantly)



(The game assets I used are all open source, so here's the names of all of the original creators! :)    Thanks to them, this game looks how it looks.)

- Knight Adventure Tileset provided by Dan Cramp

- Forest / Animals Tileset provided by Indiana Kuffer

Here are links to the tilesets if you want to create anything using them too-
